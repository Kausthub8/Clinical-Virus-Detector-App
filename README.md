# Clinical-Virus-Detector-App


A) The developement of this application was inspired from the springer paper which worked on comparing various algorithmic techniques for detecting virus based diseases from clinical text data . The virus based diseases considered in this case are COVID-19, SARS and ARDS.






B) We built a GUI based application with the help of tkinter module and also used nltk techniques like TF/IDF and BOW(Bag of words) for feature engineering purposes. Among all the
algorithms used, we achieved the highest accuracy of 96.2% with naive-bayes and also  Stochastic Gradient Boosting. 



C) This dataset contains more than 30 columns but we are extracting two column values such as ‘clinical_notes’ and ‘finding’. Comparative Analysis Graph was also built to compare various hyperparameters and also metrics like f1_score, accuracy, recall etc.
